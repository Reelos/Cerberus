# Cerberus
This one should be my first Game  
It's just a "Let's shoot Asteriods" at this point

## Controls
The Controls are the Arrow Keys and Space to fire

There are four boosts:
+ **Red**    - DamageBoost
+ **Cyan**   - FireRate
+ **Orange** - BulletSpeed
+ **Green**  - ShipSpeed

This is everything so far.

### ToDo
+ Add Textures (Thanks to Neuxz)
+ Add EnemyShips
+ Add MultipleShootBoost
+ Add UpgradingSystem
+ Add HealthBoost
+ Add HealContainer
